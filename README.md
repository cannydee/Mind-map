# Mind-Mapping
This is the mind map for Bagsbycanny.

A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize information into a hierarchy, showing relationships among pieces of the whole. It is often created around a single concept where major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those major ideas.

As a business analyst, I created a mind map for Bagsbycanny using the Xmind tool. Xmind is a mind mapping and brainstorming software used to capture ideas, clarify thinking, manage complex information and promote team collaboration.

I introduced the business, stating her mission and vision. After this, I highlighted some of her business problems identified after carrying out an analysis. I also recommended solutions based on the identified problems and projected the results of implemented solutions.
